By preparing payslips from your accounting program and sending E-Payslips, wage slips, time sheets, personnel notifications, notices, warnings, leave forms to all your personnel via KEP with a single button, you secure your company within the framework of legal obligations.\n\nAn annual fixed price is applied for our EDM Personnel KEP Applications service according to your number of personnel. No price changes are made in hiring and dismissals.
